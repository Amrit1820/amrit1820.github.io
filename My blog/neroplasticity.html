    <p class=growth>
        As studies have shown Neroplasticity can help many ways like healing from stork
        or getting brain damage during accident. Neroplasticity is a method of re wiring 
        the brain and teach our self new things.

        When I started leaning coding I have no idea all these things work, I had no family 
        memeber or friend who can give me some help. I just started sreaching online
        learnt little bit of html and css by myself and than javascript hit me. It was exciting 
        to learn new things but I was having very difficult time to compelete DOM game challagange 
        and I started doubt my self, should I do coding or not. 
        But now after learning about growth mindset I am very positive that I can learn and I will
        learn, I might have to put some more efforts and more and more code practise but I will be 
        web developer.
