        <h1>Classes and IDs</h1>
        <p>ID and Class both are selectors.So what are the selectors?
        Selectors helps us to choose a heading or pharaghraph which we want to select and than make it more pretty with the help of CSS.So we know now they both are selectors but what is diffrence in tham. The only diffrence in them is Id is very specical it can be used 
          only once but class is alwyas there for you, you can you it in headings , pharaghraph etc.
        </p>

        <P>In this images inside the red circle it is ID which can be used only once.</P>
        <p>But classess are different, we can use them many time in html.</p>
                <img src="../img/Web capture_2.jpeg" alt="">
              <p>In this image class has been used both in heading and pharghraph</p>   
                <p>There is another diffrenec in class and id is that: id starts with symbol"#" but class's symbol is "."
            If conflicting styles from an ID and class are applied to the same element, the ID will outrank the class in the cascade.
            
          Using the same ID more than once on a page will result in an error.  
          So if you  need to choose between classes and id , just ask you self are you going to use this in multiple places or 
          or just once. If it is only for one time than use id otherwise always use class.

          The <code class="language-markup">&lt;span&gt;</code> Element:
          Sometimes we donâ€™t want a style to apply to an entire text element, but just a specific subset of text.  For these instances, we use the handy <code class="language-markup">&lt;span&gt;</code> element.
