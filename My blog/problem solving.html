        <p> A little knowledge is a dangerous thing. So is a lot.~~~~Albert Einstein </p>
        <p>
        I will surly consider my self in the first part of that quote and as I am still learning how to do code 
        and many more things related to javascript. After learning basics I was feeling very confident to solve exercise 
        given in sprint 4. I was managing to solve them with bit of help from google , slack and my facilitator but really
        got stuck with loops.
        I was not able to understand what is going inside the array and than looping through it. 
        I know, it is just a simple term. But I was stuck ......
      </p>
      <p>
          How do I solve it ?
        </p>
         <p>
             I read an article  
        </p> 
          
          <div class = new2>
              <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/what-in-the-world-is-a-javascript-loop-for/" >What in the world is a JavaScript loop?</a>
              <p>
                  In this article which is from freecodecamp, everything has been explained very well, i will try to demonstrate that 
                  for this blog.So if you are going to open a shop you have a lot of stuff in your inventory but your customer doesn't until 
                  you will display it in the shelves. Similar to this a web application which can be for a business have lots of data in his
                  back end. Which can be stored in the form of objects or Array. </p>
                  <img src="../img/2022-02-25 (8).png" alt="Array image">
                 <p> Now this is everything we have in our back end system but how user will know about it.Than its time we need to use our loop. </p>
                <img src="../img/2022-02-25 (5).png" alt=" loop">
                  <p>
                  loop will go inside the array take the element out show the user and does this until last element. 
                  So I think as a web develop using loop will be everyday thing. I am sure now I will never forget where and why we need loop.
                  Other than that I try to explain method to myself sometime I record a video while doing that so I can see what was that thing in case I won't
                  remember.

  <p>
    1. Pseudocode--- I have just started this method from sprint 4 and really find it helpful Technique. </p>
<p>2.Trying something--- this method I use the most, I always try to use different set of code to figure out 
  what should be done, although its been only 2 weeks , learning javascript so logic building is improving.
</p>
  <p> 3.Rubber ducky method--- For me my rubber ducky is myself, cause I don't have real rubber ducky yet, I try to explain and remind myself
    while cooking or doing other works if nobody is around. </p> 
   <p>4.Reading error messages--- I need to work on it bit more although I felt improvement from the past      </p> 
   <p>5.Console.logging--- This method is the least usage list but I am starting to use it more specially after getting introduced with replit. </p> 
  <p>6.Googling--- Mostly used and most favorite one, somehow I feel like i am getting distracted while using it and I have to get myself to task. But Googling
    provides lots of knowledge and confidence that someone else had this problem as well not only me.
  </p> 
   <p> 7.Asking your peers for help--- I do sometime through slack .</p>
   <p> 8.Asking coaches for help--- Most reliable and easy , I feel like someone is there to help me.</p>
    <p> 9.Improving your process with reflection== This method gives time and chance to revise things. so I like this one.     </p>
