 <H1>Explain a situation where you have had an ethical decision to make. 
        Discuss how you weighed up the values involved in that decision, 
        the decision you made and the consequences of the action you took.</H1>

    <P>I had very long work history working in fast food. I was working as assistant manager and showing my trainee manager
        how to place oders for restaurant stock. I was also looking after the shift on floor. Mostly in fast food restaurant we face
        shortage of staff. So, I was going back and forth between office and drive thru and kitchen or front counter. Trainee manager was putting amount of all the stock items. Every week we ordered nearly 2 bottles of mango syrup. But by mistake or somehow, he put the amount of 200. And we just placed the order. Ideally, I should have checked order by myself before placing but I didnâ€™t and after two days we received 200 bottles of syrup and its shelf life always around 25 days. My restaurant manager called me in the office and asked about it, but I took all the responsibility and called restaurant around us to take some stock from us. I used my own car to deliver it on my day off. 
        I could have made excuse of being busy or short- staff but I decided to be responsible for my actions.
