        <H2> HTML </H2>
        <p> Html is structure of web application. Lets take an example of human body. We all human have same body structure,
            legs,arms hands etc. Same like this Html is body of web. But everyone have different hair color, skin color ,eye color or hair color
        whcih is is not part of body structure, it is part of how we look a like.    </p>
             <H2> CSS</H2>
             <p>Css helps to make body colorfull,through css we can give body different shades of colours or pattrens etc.Css can be done three ways.
                 inline, block and external. Extranl css has been pefered by most of web devlopers because it helps to keep code clean.
             </p>

             <h2>Javascript</h2>
             <p>Javascript is like a brain in human body which helps us to accoplish any tasks. As without brain 
                 body won't have any moments similar in web without javascript html and css can't accomplish anything. for example downlaoding 
                a document, buying something from e store. E- store can have beautifull layout with the help of css and html but the main fuctions like adding 
            product in the basket , going to in checkout and taking pa
            yments etc can only be done through javascript. </p>
            <h2>Control Flow </h2>
            <p>Control flow allows our program to make decisions 
                about what code is executed and when. This is where JavaScript really starts to come alive, 
                Javascript contains certain conditional statements and loops that enable us to control the flow of our code, 
                making our projects and applications more powerful, 
                dynamic and interactive. In conditional statemnts we use if statements, switch, ternary. In loops we use for loop, while loop, for..in
                 We take example of eating dinner.
            </p>
            <p>Are you hugery</p>
              <p> if yes  than eat food   </p>  
              <p>else wait  </p>    
             <H1>DOM</H1>
            <p> Dom stands for document Object Model.DOM basicaly helps us to get elements from html file and make them 
             intractive. DOM works like API which not only helps to access the elements from html also helps to manipulate it. </p>
            <h2>Arrays vs. Objects</h2>
             <p>Arrays and objects both are like storage container which helps to store data. The difference between them in the use only.
                Doing manipulations over the data as a whole, or filtering and manipulating chunks of the data? An array. But if going to manipulate only indviual data or string
            than use a object. </p>

                   <img src="../img/2022-02-22 (6).png" alt="object">                 
        
            <h2> fuctions</h2>
            <p>Functions are "self contained" modules of code that accomplish a specific task. 
                Functions usually "take in" data, process it, and "return" a result. Once a function is written, 
                it can be used over and over and over again. 
                Functions can be "called" from the inside of other functions</p>
