          <h2>Classes and IDs<h2>
              <p>At first glance, classes and IDs appear to function identically, but there are important differences between the two:
               IDs can be applied to one and only one element in a web document.Classes can be applied to an unlimited number of elements, even different types of elements on the same page.</p>
              <p> <img src="../img/tec page1.png" alt=""></p><br>
              
           <p> 
            
            If conflicting styles from an ID and class are applied to the same element, the ID will outrank the class in the cascade.

            
              Using the same ID more than once on a page will result in an error.  
              So if you  need to choose between classess and id , just ask you self are you going to use this in multiple places or 
              or just once. If it is only for one time than use id otherwise always use class.
            
            The <span> Element
            Sometimes we donâ€™t want a style to apply to an entire text element, but just a specific subset of text.  For these instances, we use the handy <span> element:
