    <h2>What is your long term goal and/or career pathway?</h2>
    <p>Currently my main goal is to grab the knowledge and clear my all doubts regarding coding.
         I have tendency of taking short cuts and gets the things done but I want to change it. 
         I want to built habit of learning right things with right way. 
         Coding and programming are very new to me, my qualifications were in hospitality management. 
         I have been working in this field from last 10 years but now my focus is to crack a job in web development industry. 
         I am enjoying coding very much , although I had to push my tec blog at least 10 times to check if CSS file is working or not,
          I might learn machine learning in future if I get chance. </p>
          <h2>	A description of your own strengths and limitations in relation to learning?</h2>
          <p> 
            My strengths would be I don’t like to give up and always try to find a way rather than giving up on task. 
            Lots of time I find solutions through google or YouTube tutorials. I am so happy that i got my facliltor who always help me when ever i asked.
            My limitations are logical thinking toward code. But I am sure it will improve through practice.
            </p>
            <h2>What skills (non-technical - human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</h2>
            <p>•	
                Coding skills, logic building and teamwork. 
                I feel like Eda is giving us same environment as we might get at future workplace. 
                Our facilitators are like senior web developers, and we are junior. 
                We are building code and they are reviewing to make sure it will work. 
                Although they are always there but google is our first place to get our solution. 
                We must know what the point is when we need to get help from them rather than getting stuck on one place
                 for a week. All these things are preparing us for job.
                </p>
                <h2>A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme.</h2>
                <p>I don't have any work related commitment but i have 2 kids and my husband works full time.they both are going day care 9am to 3pm 
                    but during bootcamp, they will be attending day care 8am to 5pm, I feel like it's gona be long hours but its only for nine week
